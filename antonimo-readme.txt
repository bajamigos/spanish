Antonimo: Word Ladder Game
Objective: Build a "ladder" of words from a start word to an end word, using intermediary words that gradually escalate a specific attribute (e.g., intensity, formality).
How to Play:

Select category (e.g., Verb, Noun) and gradability type (e.g., Volume, Velocity).
Game presents start/end pair and hint (e.g., "This escalates volume of sound production.").
Fill/reorder 5 intermediaries in order of progression.
Submit; check if matches correct ladder.
Use hint for clues; new game for retry.

Tips: Words must logically scale the attribute. Single-player or tutor-student collab. Focus on synonyms/antonyms with gradation.
For digital: Drag inputs to reorder; submit checks sequence.
Win: Correct order unlocks next round.
=== Game Theory and Concepts ===
Antonimo draws from linguistic gradability, where words scale along attributes like intensity or formality. We discussed scalable attributes as "qualities" or "dimensions" for progression, e.g., sound volume (whisper-scream) or emotion (irritated-furious).
Key Theory:

Gradability: Words' ability to vary in degree. Adjectives/verbs are inherently gradable (e.g., comparatives: big-bigger); nouns via hierarchies (e.g., drop-ocean).
Semantic Hierarchies: Broader steps in nouns (more intermediaries) vs. tighter scales in pronouns/prepositions.
Parts of Speech Ranking (Inherent Gradability): Adjectives (10), Adverbs (8), Verbs (7), Nouns (6), Pronouns (4), Prepositions (3), Conjunctions (2), Interjections (1).
Semantic Hierarchy Ranking: Nouns (8), Verbs (7), Adjectives (6), etc.
Attributes Split: From broad "intensity" to specifics like Volume, Velocity, Force, Magnitude, Affective Depth, Formality, Abstraction, Poetic Complexity.

Improves vocab, precision, fluency.
=== Linguistic Jargon ===

Gradable: Terms modifiable by degree (e.g., very hot; not *very chair).
Scalar: Involving scales (e.g., intensity ladder).
Semantic Escalation: Progressive meaning shift.
Morphology: Word form changes (e.g., comparatives/superlatives).
Pragmatics: Contextual use (e.g., formality in registers).
Synonym Chains: Linked words by similarity/gradation.
Antonym Pairs: Opposites as ladder ends.
Lexical Field: Related words (e.g., temperature: cool-scorching).

Use for deeper ladders.
